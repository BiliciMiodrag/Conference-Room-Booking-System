# Conference Room Booking System

I developed a project that allowed the planning of events and the management of conference rooms. I used the ASP.NET CORE MVC framework with a relational database (MySQL), the FullCalendar library for the calendar, ASP.NET CORE Identity for the authentication part, Bootstrap Modal for form boxes, Bootstrap 4, Axios for HTTP requests and xUnit for testing.
